# Zumji - Decentralized Marketplace (peer to peer)

## Overview:

Zumji is a decentralized marketplace built on the Celo  (Mainnet) that enables users to buy and sell digital items. The platform operates on a peer-to-peer structure, facilitating transactions directly between buyers and sellers. Funds are securely stored in the Zumji smart contract until the seller delivers or sends the item to the buyer, and the buyer confirms receipt of the product. Zumji also integrates a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure to manage disputes, ensuring fair and transparent resolution mechanisms.
